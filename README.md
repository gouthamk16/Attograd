Attograd: A Lightweight Neural Network Framework (WIP)
------------------------------------------------------

Attograd is a lightweight framework for building and training neural networks in Python. It offers a simple and intuitive API for defining neural network architectures and training them on datasets.

**Current Stage (WIP):**

This repository currently implements a basic Perceptron model. More complex architectures and functionalities are actively under development.

**Installation (For Now):**

This is a work-in-progress project, and there is no formal installation method yet. To use the current code:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

Use code with caution

**TO-DO** (1-Highest Priority)

1. Test the tensor implementation (tensor.py)
2. Implement a simple gradcheck for the tensor implementation (for all grad functions)
3. Implement one-hot-encoding, max, min, avg and dot product methods in the tensor class.
4. Implement fully connected nn.
5. Implement reverse addition, subtraction, etc. (like rmul) to rearrange arguments as per need
6. Implement broadcasting
