Attograd: A Lightweight Neural Network Framework (WIP)
------------------------------------------------------

Attograd is a lightweight framework for building and training neural networks in Python. It offers a simple and intuitive API for defining neural network architectures and training them on datasets.

**Current Stage (WIP):**

This repository currently implements a basic Perceptron model. More complex architectures and functionalities are actively under development.

**Installation (For Now):**

This is a work-in-progress project, and there is no formal installation method yet. To use the current code:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Use code with caution

**TO-DO** (1-Highest Priority)

1. Gradcheck for the tensor functions (for all functions with grad)
2. Implement one-hot-encoding, max, min, avg and dot product methods in the tensor class.
3. Implement matmul in Tensor
4. Test backprop for Linear layer (gradcheck)
5. Test Linear layer using a training loop
6. Implement reverse division
7. Implement broadcasting
